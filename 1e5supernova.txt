all of the elements comes from a supernova
hydrogen->helium+energy->carbon->oxygen
small stars like sun fuel runs out when carbon forms
outer layers expand and inner layers collapse
white dwarf - contains oxygen and carbon
shines for billion of years
vast majority of stars orbit in pairs
if one dies and forms into a dwarf it starts eating the other
becomes denser heavier and unstable
carbon and oxygen fuses into iron
goes into nuclear overload and explodes
most iron comes from white dwarf - double star supernova also called type 1A supernova
heavier elements like gold and silver from single star supernova
iron eats up all the energy of the star and all layers containing other elements explode because core collapses
in the blast iron becomes cobalt->nickel->platinum->uranium
layers can take million of years to make but explosion takes seconds
8 times bigger than sun leave a neutron star
pulsar - neutron star which rotate at a great speed and emit beams from their north and south poles
30 times bigger than sun - magnetars
generates powerful magnetic fields
100 million times the magnetic field of earth
supermassive stars - 100 times heavier than the sun black holes
its called hypernova
crushes space and time itself
rest star forms accretion disk and feeds the black hole
it spits out at nearly speed of light
creates two beams - gamma ray bursts
brightest things in the entire universe
100 million times brighter than supernova
wr 104 2 dying stars
closest dying star - eta carinae

energy of moving gases amount to only 1% of the total energy of the supernova explosion
rest 99%?
neutrino
supernova 1987A
neutrinos are trillion of times smaller than the atom
created by all types of nuclear reactions
when the core crushes down before a supernova the atoms inside are broken up
core heatens up and turns the atomic debris into blazing neutrinos
gravity cant hold these neutrinos in the core so it blows up the star into a supernova
type 1A supernovas
we know that it explodes at exactly 1.4 times the mass of our sun and also the amount of light it emits
so we use it to measure distances across the universe
expanison is actually speeding up - we get to know from 1A type although the universe should slow down because of gravity
