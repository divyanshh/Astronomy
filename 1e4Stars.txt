eta carinae 5 million times larger than our sun
betelguese 300 times larger than eta carinae
v y canis majoris billion times bigger than our sun
stars start as a cloud of dust and gas called nebula
flame nebula
horsehead nebula
orion nebula
nebula is a star nursery
millions of new stars are born
2004 spitzer space telescope infrared
only sees heat
heat passes through the clouds
gravity brings together the clouds formih=ng a vortex
at centre gravity crushes the gas under huge temperatures superdense and superhot
photon takes thousand of years to reach the surface of a star
huge energy gives rise to waves at the surface which lead to solar wind and they give rise to huge magnetic fields(loops)
clash of magnetic loops trigger solar wind
death of star
gravity wins with fusion and collapses the outer layers but fusion fights heating the outer layers  and size increases
core becomes unstable with no fuel now it fuses helium to carbon atoms blasting out energy which blows out outer layers
all that remains is the core which is called white dwarf
bigger stars such as betelguese
bigger and bigger elements are synthesized
iron is made
iron absorbs energy
iron does not fuse further
fusion hits a dead end
gravity wins outer layers collapses and huge explosion is generated
a supernova is generated
This happens in just a few seconds
neutron star is formed
unbelievablu heavy
a sugarcube = all the cars
everything released in a supernova generates life(stardust) full of elements like oxygen hydrogen carbon iron etc.
only supenova generates these elements
supernova gave rise to our galaxy
